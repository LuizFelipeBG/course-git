#  REVERTING MASTER COMMITS

* Good for branch master:
-> keep the time line safe (history).
    
    git revert { hash of the commit }

OR   

* Good for seperated branchs:
-> come back to the hash specified and ignores everything later.
    
    git reset --hard { hash of the commit }

-> come back to the hash specified and put the another changes in stage.
    
    git reset --soft { hash of the commit }
